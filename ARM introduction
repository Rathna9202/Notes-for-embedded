ARM is everyware (all electronic items)
ARM is reduced instruction set computer(RISC) instruction set architecture(ISA) developed by ARM holdings
A processor that could deliver,
  -High performance
  -Energy Efficient
ARM Architecture specifies,
  -Instruction set
  -Register set
  -Exception model
  -Memory model
  -Debug,Trace and Profiling
Risc - Reduced Instruction Set Computer
     - Simple Instructions
Micro architecture - The build and design of  processor is referred to as micro architecture
The architecture consists of Microarchitecture and the Microarchitecture consists of Implementations
ARM processor families group multiple preprocessors, and were named chronologically,
    starting with Arm1(1985) upto Arm11(2002)
There are Three types of Profiles.They are,
  - A application Profile
  - R Real time Profile
  - M Micro contoller Profile
