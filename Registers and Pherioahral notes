Ram is registered from ,
    0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF

It consist of some peripharals like,
    GPIO
    I2C
    Timer
    UART

The peripharals are mapped in different address between 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF , The details are avail in Data sheet
The peripharals are mapped in different address is known as Boundary address

GPIOx (x => A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H) each consists of different registers that,
    modeR
    OtypeR
    OspeeedR
    BSSR

Base address of GPIOA and AHB1 is 0x40020000
    GPIOA - Peripharal
    AHB1 - Bus
